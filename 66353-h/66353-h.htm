  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>In publishing the first Bulletin of the American National Red Cross
the Central Committee takes pleasure in being able to make manifest
not only an evidence of the work of the Committee during the short
period of the existence of the Corporation, but also the evident interest
in the work by the community at large, as shown by the organization
of branch societies in the District of Columbia, the Philippine Islands
and in sixteen States.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people of the United States are gradually awakening to the
realization of the fact that while we have taken our place as a world
power politically and commercially, we are far behind other nations
in this great work of philanthropy. It is the object of the American
National Red Cross, under its new charter, and under supervision of
the National Government, to demonstrate the existence of humanitarian
as well as commercial interests in the people of the United States,
and the Central Committee appeals to them not only to use their
personal influence to enlarge the membership of the branches already
formed, but to assist the Committee in organizing branches in States
and Territories where none now exist.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Committee would be pleased to receive communications referring
to more complete organization from those interested in the work
of the Corporation, and especially from persons in the States and
Territories where branch societies have not yet been formed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The enclosed report is the official report of the Corporation to Congress
as required by the charter, and the expense of printing by the
Government Printing Office the copies issued with this Bulletin is
borne by the American National Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chairman of Central Committee.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: Pursuant to the provisions of an act of Congress approved January
5, 1905, entitled “An act to incorporate the American National
Red Cross,” and providing that the report of its proceedings shall be
duly received and audited by the War Department, I have the honor
to transmit herewith copy of report of the proceedings of the American
National Red Cross for the part of the year 1905 during which

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: In accordance with the act of Congress entitled “An act to
incorporate the American National Red Cross,” approved January 5,
1905, I have the honor to make the following report of the proceedings
of the American National Red Cross for the part of the year 1905 during
which the corporation has been in existence.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>By virtue of the act above referred to the American National Red
Cross was incorporated, succeeding to all the rights and property which
had been hitherto held and to all the duties which had been hitherto
performed by the American National Red Cross as a corporation duly
incorporated by act of Congress, June 6, 1900, which act was repealed
and the organization created thereby dissolved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The President of the United States appointed William K. Van
Reypen chairman of the central committee, and Francis B. Loomis,
Charles Hallam Keep, George B. Davis, Louis A. Pradt, John C.
Boyd, Mabel T. Boardman, Cleveland H. Dodge, Samuel Mather,
H. Kirke Porter, John Sharp Williams, and Frederick H. Gillett
members.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first meeting of the board of incorporators was held in the
diplomatic room of the Department of State on February 8, 1905, and
the following-named officers of the corporation were elected: President
of the board of incorporators, William H. Taft; treasurer, Charles
Hallam Keep; counselor, Louis A. Pradt; secretary, Charles L. Magee.
As members of the central committee, Redfield Proctor, William Alden
Smith, Walter Wyman, James R. Garfield, Hilary A. Herbert, and
George H. Shields.</p>

<p class='c010'>The treasurer subsequently appointed as assistant treasurer Henry
H. Flather, assistant cashier of the Riggs National Bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>The central committee elected as an executive committee Francis B.
Loomis, George B. Davis, Louis A. Pradt, John C. Boyd, Hilary A.
Herbert, James R. Garfield, and Miss Mabel T. Boardman.</p>

<p class='c010'>This committee immediately commenced the work of organizing
State and Territorial branch societies, as directed by section 5 of the
charter, and adopted regulations for their organization and government.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was considered advisable to have all members of the corporation
affiliated with the branch societies in the States where they reside, in
order that they might have a local as well as a general interest in Red
Cross work, and that State organizations could take immediate charge
of any work in their States, under the authority of the central committee,
which committee would take control in case the work assumed
proportions beyond the resources of the State branch.</p>

<p class='c010'>By personal request and correspondence the committee endeavored
to obtain the names of representative men and women in the various
States and Territories who would be interested in the work of organization,
and, after obtaining them, addressed to them requests to act as
organizers of branch societies. The committee has been gratified to
note the general interest manifested in the work, although in some of
the States a sufficient number of affirmative responses were not received
to warrant the commencement of the organization. Requests to others
have been sent and the committee is proceeding with its work with all

to the central committee the names and addresses of representative
men and women in their States or Territories who they think would be
interested in the organization of branch societies.</p>

<p class='c026'>The present corporation received from the old corporation, which
ceased to exist by virtue of the act approved January 5, 1905, a quantity
of miscellaneous literature and incomplete records which have
been of very little value; also a few articles of furniture. The treasurer
received the sum of $291.89 and a notice of indebtedness of
$1,250, contracted to pay a claim of Francis Atwater for printing and
postage for the old corporation. This indebtedness has since been
paid from the proceeds of the sale of lots 14, 15, 16, and 17, block 25,
Kalorama Heights. These lots were the property of the American
National Red Cross, and were sold on January 11, 1904, by the then
president of the American National Red Cross, to Cogan Bros. &amp;
Forschner for the sum of $16,500. Monthly payments of the purchase
money were to be made according to the quantity of stone
removed from the property, with a minimum monthly payment of
$200. Five thousand and seventy-five dollars had been paid before
transfer to the present corporation. Four thousand three hundred
and twelve dollars has since been paid, leaving a balance due of $7,113.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trusteeship of the property that was formerly held by Charles
A. Baker and S. W. Briggs has been transferred and is now held by
Charles Hallam Keep and James C. McReynolds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corporation has now no outstanding debts, but a suit has been
brought against it by Hugh Ross in the superior court of Santa Barbara,
Cal., for the sum of $990 for alleged services rendered and material
supplied the old corporation at Manila in 1900. The suit is being
defended by the counselor of the corporation.</p>

<p class='c010'>A tender of service was made to the Surgeon-General of the Public
Health and Marine-Hospital Service during the late epidemic of yellow
fever in Louisiana, and the committee was informed that the work was
well in hand and there was no immediate necessity for additional aid,
but if at any time assistance was needed the committee would be
notified. The work was so effectually done by the Public Health and
Marine-Hospital Service that aid from the Red Cross was never required.</p>

<p class='c010'>In response to a request for aid from the Philippine branch of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Red Cross for the sufferers from a typhoon, a contribution of $500
was made by cable transfer from the emergency fund of the corporation.</p>

<p class='c010'>All money received from life membership dues is deposited to the
credit of the endowment fund, the interest alone of which can be used,
if necessary, in emergency work. All of the officers of the corporation,
except the secretary and assistant treasurer, render gratuitous
service. The secretary receives $100 a month and the assistant treasurer
$250 a year. The office rent is $20 a month. These, with the
necessary outlay for stationery, printing, and postage, comprise the
whole of the current expenses of the corporation.</p>

December 5, 1905, the following officers were elected:</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
